## My dotfiles have aged, they're now `v2` !!!

My initial `dotfiles` were a great success for me, but I've since swapped several technologies,
mainly the installer (using the amazing [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)) and using
[Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) instead of zsh (Never looking back).

It is said that "You cannot clone the same dotfiles twice" - [Wiki](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Heraclitus#Quotes).

**Note:**

My dotfiles have been completely revamped on 27/10/2019. Looking for
the old version with Zsh and an installer? [Click here](https://github.com/pgilad/dotfiles/tree/v1)

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pgilad/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

$ ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
